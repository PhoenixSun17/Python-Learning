#Unsorted Input: [3,2,4,1]
#Sorted Output: [1,2,3,4]
#Algorithm Output: [4,2,4,3] ïƒŸ indices where flips where performed (4 flips total)

#We have performed 4 flips (bold indicates it has been flipped):
#Start:            [3, 2, 4, 1]
#1st flip (k = 4): [1, 4, 2, 3]
#2nd flip (k = 2): [4, 1, 2, 3]
#3rd flip (k = 4): [3, 2, 1, 4]
#4th flip (k = 3): [1, 2, 3, 4]
