	Write a 1000-word analysis and design report of your Python program. 
Describe how your solution solves the problem and identify the evidence you gained through testing. 
You are encouraged to include diagrams to illustrate your solution, and small snippets from your code. 
You can use excerpts from your program and they will not be included in your word count. 
Your report should identify the quality of the solution with respect to the information given, and the programming techniques that have been applied and tested in Python 3
